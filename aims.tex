\chapter{Aims of the thesis}

The overall aims of this thesis were to investigate the association between BMI and prostate cancer incidence and mortality, and to address specific methodological issues related to the analysis of primary and aggregated data.

\bigskip

 More specifically, the aims were:

\begin{itemize}
\item To assess the association between BMI during middle-late adulthood and during early adulthood and localized/advanced prostate cancer incidence and mortality in a population-based cohort of Swedish men.

\item To summarize the existing epidemiologic evidence on the association between BMI during middle-late adulthood and the incidence of prostate cancer by subtype of the disease. 

\item To extend the use of  quantile regression for censored data, and in particular of Laplace regression,  to those situations where the time scale of interest is attained age at the event instead of follow-up time.

\item To discuss how RAP has been misinterpreted in the epidemiologic literature and to show how RAP is profoundly sensitive to the specification of disease dependence on age.

\item To present and discuss relevant methods to evaluate the goodness of fit of dose--response meta-analyses of binary outcomes. 
\end{itemize}
